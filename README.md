# identity-based-linkable-ring-signature
In this project, we implement the lattice-based IdLRS scheme proposed in oour paper on dentity-based linkable ring signature.

## Programming Laguage: SageMath 9.2 (Python 3.8)
## Main procedures:
### Lattice trapdoor mechanism via [MP12]
### Hash functions
### Main algorithms: setup, Keygen, Extract, Sign, Verify and Link
